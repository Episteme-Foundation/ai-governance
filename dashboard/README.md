# AI Governance Dashboard

React web dashboard for monitoring governance activity. See [docs/dashboard.md](../docs/dashboard.md) for full documentation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time)
npm install

# Start dev server (with API proxy to localhost:3000)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

The backend must be running (`npm run dev` from the project root) for the dashboard to load data.
