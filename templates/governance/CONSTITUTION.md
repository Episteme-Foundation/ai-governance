# Project Constitution

This document defines the governance structure for this project.

## Decision Making

All significant decisions are logged with reasoning, alternatives considered,
and conditions that would change the decision.

## Roles

Governance roles are defined in `.governance/agents/`. Each role has specific
authority, tools, and constraints.

## Challenges

Any decision can be challenged. Challenges must include an argument and
evidence. The decision-maker must respond substantively to the argument itself.

## Amendments

This constitution can be amended by maintainers with elevated trust, following
the standard decision-logging process.
