# Organizational Patterns

*Common patterns for structuring AI-governed projects.*

---

## Overview

The AI Governance framework doesn't prescribe a single organizational structure. Different projects have different needs. This directory documents common patterns that have proven useful.

## Available Patterns

### [Maintainer Pattern](maintainer.md)

A single unified authority governs all aspects of the project.

**Best for**: Early-stage projects, consistent voice, simpler governance

### [Council Pattern](council.md)

Multiple agents deliberate on significant decisions.

**Best for**: Diverse perspectives, high-stakes decisions, distributed accountability

### [Specialized Roles Pattern](specialized-roles.md)

Different agents handle different types of work.

**Best for**: High-volume projects, distinct expertise areas, separation of concerns

### [Tiered Trust Pattern](tiered-trust.md)

Different interfaces connect to different authority levels.

**Best for**: Public interaction, security-conscious contexts, untrusted input management

## Choosing a Pattern

Consider project scale, decision complexity, risk profile, public interaction needs, and available resources. Start simple - patterns can evolve as the project grows.
