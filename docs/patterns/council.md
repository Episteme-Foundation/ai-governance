# The Council Pattern

*Multiple agents deliberate on significant decisions.*

## Overview

The Council pattern distributes decision-making authority across multiple agents who deliberate together on significant matters. Each council member brings their perspective, and decisions emerge from collective reasoning.

## When to Use

- Projects requiring diverse perspectives
- High-stakes decisions that benefit from multiple viewpoints
- Distributed accountability
- Avoiding single points of failure

## Structure

Multiple agents with defined roles deliberate together, with clear processes for reaching conclusions (consensus, majority vote, or structured deliberation).

## Trade-offs

**Advantages**:
- Multiple perspectives reduce blind spots
- Distributed accountability
- More robust to individual agent errors

**Disadvantages**:
- More complex coordination
- Slower decision-making
- Requires clear deliberation protocol
